# Contributing

Thanks for helping keep this list useful. Corrections are as welcome as additions — a fixed
description or a removed dead link is worth as much as a new record.

## What qualifies

A record is a good fit when most of these are true:

- Its official URL resolves, and the redirect target is still the product.
- Every required field can be filled from public information.
- It is not a duplicate of a record already in the dataset.
- There is enough public information to describe it accurately.
- It covers something the existing entries in that category do not.

We will not list:

- Broken, parked, or login-walled sites with no public information.
- Products that have shut down or been folded into something else.
- Affiliate landing pages, coupon sites, and lead-capture funnels.
- Near-identical clones with no meaningful difference.
- Anything whose main activity is clearly illegal, or NSFW-focused products.
- Anything submitted purely as a promotional exercise.
- Products whose domain has lapsed and now serves a resale or parking page.
- Products whose URL redirects to an unrelated domain, which usually means a rename nobody has resolved.
- Records that cannot be classified into the published 20-category taxonomy.
- Anything requiring a field the public schema deliberately excludes.

## Two ways to contribute

### Open an issue

Fastest option, and fine if you would rather not touch Markdown.

- [Suggest a correction](../../issues/new?template=suggest-a-record.yml)
- [Report a broken link](../../issues/new?template=report-a-broken-link.yml)

### Open a pull request

Edit `README.md` directly and open a pull request. One logical change per pull request:
one record added, or one category corrected, or one batch of dead links removed.
Mixed pull requests take much longer to review and are usually sent back.

## Entry format

Every entry follows the same shape:

```md
- **[Record Name](https://example.com/)** — What it does, in one sentence. `Freemium` `Web`
```

Rules:

1. **Link to the official website.** Not a review page, not a directory listing, not a
   referral or affiliate link, not a URL shortener. HTTPS, and the canonical form — no
   tracking parameters, no `?utm_...`, no trailing junk.
2. **Name it the way its own site does.** Not the SEO title, not "Name AI Best Free
   Generator".
3. **Description: 8 to 25 words, 35 at the absolute most.** One sentence. Say what it does
   and who would use it.
4. **Write it yourself.** Do not paste the vendor's tagline or their homepage hero copy.
5. **No superlatives.** No "leading", "revolutionary", "best-in-class", "game-changing",
   "cutting-edge". No claims about user counts, funding, or awards.
6. **Pricing labels are fixed.** Use only `Free`, `Freemium`, `Paid`, `Open Source`,
   `Free Trial`. Up to two per entry. No dollar amounts — they go stale too fast.
7. **Platform labels are optional.** Use only where they are genuinely useful and you are
   sure: `Web`, `Windows`, `macOS`, `Linux`, `iOS`, `Android`, `API`, `CLI`,
   `Browser Extension`, `VS Code`, `JetBrains`, `Discord`. If you are guessing, leave it out.
8. **Alphabetical order by `name`, across the whole file.** The data files are sorted by
   name, not grouped by category. Ignore punctuation and a leading "The", and insert in the
   right place rather than appending to the end.
9. **One category per record.** Pick the primary use case. Cross-listing the same
   entry in several categories is what makes these lists unreadable.
10. **Do not add TiorAI links.** This dataset carries none, in any field. `official_url` is
    the product's own site and it is the only link a record holds.

### A worked example

```md
Ollama,https://ollama.com/,,Developer infrastructure and models,Coding and development,Free; Open Source,Windows; macOS; Linux; CLI,"Runs open-weight language models locally from a single command.",true,true,2026-08-18
```

## Before you open the pull request

- Search `data/ai-tools.csv` for the name **and** the domain. Renames and acquisitions mean
  the same product can already be listed under a different name.
- Open the URL in a private window and confirm it loads without a redirect chain.
- Check the pricing label against the vendor's own pricing page.
- Confirm your entry is in the right alphabetical position.

## Disclose any relationship

If you work for the company, founded it, invested in it, or are being paid to submit it, say
so in the issue or the pull request description. This is not disqualifying and it will not
count against you. Undisclosed promotion that we find later gets the entry removed.

## What happens next

Maintainers review every submission and keep final editorial control. Descriptions are often
edited for length and consistency before merging — that is normal, not a criticism of your
writing.

Submitting a record does not guarantee it will be listed. It can be declined
because the category is already well covered, because we could not verify enough about it,
or simply because we did not think it earned a slot. We will say which, and there is no
appeal process beyond a polite argument in the thread.
